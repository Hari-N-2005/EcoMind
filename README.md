# EcoMind

EcoMind is a Chrome extension that helps users make ethical and sustainable shopping decisions by analyzing product pages in real time using AI.

When a user visits a product page, the extension can be triggered to extract relevant content, generate a concise summary of the brand’s environmental impact, labor practices, and overall transparency.

It visually displays trust scores across key categories—like sustainability, labor ethics, and animal welfare—and allows users to ask natural-language questions for instant AI-generated answers.

## Getting Started

To use the AI features of this extension, you need to have a Google AI API key for the Gemini API.

1.  Get your API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
2.  Create a file named `.env` in the root of the project.
3.  Copy the contents of `.env.example` into `.env`.
4.  Replace the placeholder `"YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"` in the `.env` file with your actual API key.
