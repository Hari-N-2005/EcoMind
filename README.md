# EcoMind

EcoMind is a Chrome extension that helps users make ethical and sustainable shopping decisions by analyzing product pages in real time using AI.

When a user visits a product page, the extension can be triggered to extract relevant content, generate a concise summary of the brand’s environmental impact, labor practices, and overall transparency.

It visually displays trust scores across key categories—like product quality, value for money, customer satisfaction, ease of use delivery and packaging, etc.
