# EcoMind

EcoMind is a Chrome extension that helps users make ethical and sustainable shopping decisions by analyzing product pages in real time using AI.

When a user visits a product page, the extension can be triggered to extract relevant content, generate a concise summary of the brand’s environmental impact, labor practices, and overall transparency.

It visually displays trust scores across key categories—like sustainability, labor ethics, and animal welfare—and allows users to ask natural-language questions for instant AI-generated answers.

## Getting Started

To use the AI features of this extension, you need to have an OpenAI API key.

1.  Get your API key from [OpenAI](https://beta.openai.com/signup/).
2.  Open the file `src/openai.js`.
3.  Replace the placeholder `"YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"` with your actual API key.
